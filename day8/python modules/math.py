'''import math: This line imports the math module, 
which provides various mathematical functions and 
constants for numerical operations.

print(math.pi): This line prints the value of the 
mathematical constant π (pi), which is approximately 3.141592653589793.

print(math.sqrt(16)): This line calculates the square 
root of 16 using the sqrt() function from the math module and prints the result, which is 4.0.

print(math.ceil(3.7)): This line uses the ceil() 
function from the math module to round up the number 
3.7 to the nearest integer and prints the result, which is 4.

print(math.floor(3.7)): This line uses the floor() 
function from the math module to round down the number 
3.7 to the nearest integer and prints the result, which is 3.

print(math.pow(2, 3)): This line calculates 2 raised to the 
power of 3 using the pow() function from the math module and prints the result, which is 8.0.

print(math.sin(math.pi / 2)): This line calculates the sine 
of π/2 radians using the sin() function from the math module 
and prints the result, which is approximately 1.0. Note that 
math.sin() function takes input in radians, so math.pi / 2 represents 
π/2 radians which is equivalent to 90 degrees.'''
