1. Write a Python program that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 15. The program should:

Skip printing the number 10 using the continue statement.
Stop the loop entirely if the number reaches 13 using the break statement.
Print all other numbers in the range.

2. Write a Python program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 20. The program should:

Skip printing the even numbers using the continue statement.
Stop the loop entirely if the number is a multiple of 7 using the break statement.
Print all other numbers in the range.

3.Write a Python program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 30. The program should:

Skip printing the multiples of 3 using the continue statement.
Stop the loop entirely after printing the number 15 using the break statement.
Print all other numbers in the range.

4.Write a Python program that iterates through numbers from 10 to 30. The program should:

Skip printing the numbers ending in 5 using the continue statement.
Stop the loop entirely if the number reaches 25 using the break statement.
Print all other numbers in the range.

5. Write a Python program that iterates through numbers from 45 to 65. The program should:

Skip printing the numbers greater than 50 using the continue statement.
Stop the loop entirely if the number reaches 60 using the break statement.
Print all other numbers in the range.

6. Write a Python program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 50. The program should:

Skip even numbers using the continue statement.
Stop the loop when a number is a multiple of 7 using the break statement.
Calculate and print the sum of the odd numbers encountered up to the point where the loop stops.
