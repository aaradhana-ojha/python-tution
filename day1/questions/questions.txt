1. Write a Python program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. 
Hint
Ask the user to input the length and width of the rectangle as 
floating-point numbers. Then, compute and display the perimeter of the rectangle.


2.. Develop a Python program that computes the volume of a rectangular prism. 
Hint
Ask the user to input the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism 
as floating-point numbers. Calculate and print the volume of the prism.

3. Create a Python program to determine the area of a circle. 
Hint
Prompt the user to input the radius of the circle as a 
floating-point number. Then, compute and display the area of the circle.

4. wap to calculate a simple interest.

5. Write a Python program that demonstrates the 
concept of mutable and immutable 
objects. Define an integer variable
 x as an immutable object and a list variable 
y as a mutable object. Ask the user to 
enter either 'i' for immutable or 'm' for 
mutable. If the user chooses 'i', modify x 
by adding 5 to it; if 'm' is chosen, 
append the value 4 to list y. Print the 
updated values of x or y accordingly. 
Ensure to handle invalid inputs as well.


6. Consider a scenario where you're tasked with designing a 
simple income tax calculator program in Python. The program 
should take the user's income as input and calculate the income 
tax based on predefined tax brackets. The tax rates are as follows:

    0% tax for income up to $10,000
    10% tax for income between $10,001 and $30,000
    20% tax for income between $30,001 and $60,000
    30% tax for income exceeding $60,000
