'''In the given code, the if __name__ == '__main__': part acts as a guard. 
Let's break it down in simpler terms:

Purpose:
Think of it like a gatekeeper for our program. 
It ensures that certain parts of our code only 
run when we directly run this file. If someone 
imports this file into another program, 
these parts won't run automatically.

Example:
Imagine we have a big house with many rooms. 
Some rooms are only meant for us (like our bedroom), 
but others are open for guests. This guard makes sure 
that only the parts of the house meant for guests are 
accessible when someone visits, while our private areas stay private.

Importance:
It's important because it gives us control over when certain 
parts of our code run. This can prevent confusion or errors, 
especially when others use our code in their own programs.

So, in the context of our code:

The main() function is like the part of our house where guests are welcomed.
The if __name__ == '__main__': guard ensures that the main() 
function is only called when we directly run this file, not when it's imported into another program.
Overall, it helps organize and control how our program behaves depending on how it's being used.'''
