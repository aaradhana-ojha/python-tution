Data Structure in Python: Stack
Introduction to Data Structures in Python
A data structure is a way of organizing, managing, and storing data in a format that enables efficient access and modification. Python provides several built-in data structures, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Additionally, Python allows for the implementation of more complex data structures, like stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees, using its flexible and dynamic data types.

Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in many applications, including function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

Implementation of Stack Using List
In Python, a stack can be implemented using the built-in list data type. Lists in Python allow for dynamic resizing and provide methods to append and remove elements, making them suitable for stack implementation.

Creating a Stack
To create a stack, you simply initialize an empty list. 
stack = []
Adding Elements into the Stack (Push Operation)
To add elements to the stack, you use the append() method of the list, which adds an element to the end of the list.
# Adding elements into the stack
stack.append(10)
stack.append(20)
stack.append(30)

print(stack)  # Output: [10, 20, 30]


Checking for Empty Stack
Before performing operations like popping elements from the stack, it is good practice to check if the stack is empty. This can be done using the not operator.

def is_empty(stack):
    return len(stack) == 0

print(is_empty(stack))  # Output: False
Deleting Elements from the Stack (Pop Operation)
To remove elements from the stack, you use the pop() method, which removes and returns the last element from the list.

# Removing elements from the stack
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 30
print(stack)        # Output: [10, 20]


Traversing Stack Elements
To traverse the elements of the stack, you can use a simple loop. Traversing means accessing each element of the stack without modifying it.

# Traversing stack elements
for element in stack:
    print(element)


Applications of Stack
Stacks are used in various applications, including:

Function Call Management: Stacks are used to keep track of function calls in recursion.
Expression Evaluation: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions and convert expressions from infix to postfix/prefix.
Undo Mechanism: Most text editors use a stack to keep track of the user's last actions for the undo feature.
Syntax Parsing: Compilers use stacks for parsing syntax and checking for balanced parentheses in expressions.
Backtracking: Algorithms that need to explore all possible options (like solving mazes) use stacks to keep track of the path.
