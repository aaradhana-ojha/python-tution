The csv module in Python is a built-in library that 
provides functionality to read from and write to CSV 
(Comma-Separated Values) files. CSV is a common data 
format used for storing tabular data, where each line 
in the file corresponds to a row, and each value in a
row is separated by a comma (or another delimiter).

Key Features of the csv Module
Reading CSV Files: The module provides functionality 
to read data from CSV files using csv.reader(), 
which allows you to iterate over the rows in the file and access the data.

Writing CSV Files: You can write data to CSV files using csv.writer(), 
which allows you to write rows of data to the file.

Custom Delimiters: The module supports different delimiters 
(e.g., tab, semicolon) by specifying the delimiter parameter.

Quote Handling: The module can handle quoted fields and escape 
characters, providing robust parsing of complex CSV files.

example
import csv

data = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
    ['Alice', 30, 'New York'],
    ['Bob', 25, 'Los Angeles'],
    ['Charlie', 35, 'Chicago']
]

with open('example.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerows(data)


What is the csv Module in Python?
The csv module in Python is a tool that helps you work with CSV files. 
CSV stands for "Comma-Separated Values." Imagine you have a table of data, 
like a spreadsheet in Excel, where each row represents a record and each column 
represents a piece of information about that record. In a CSV file, each row of 
the table is stored as a line of text, and the columns are separated by commas.

For example, a CSV file might look like this:
Name,Age,City
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
