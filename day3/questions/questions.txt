for loop

1. wap to print table of number ask number from user  
use for and range and print till 10 in table.

2. wap to print cube of number from 10 to 18.

3. Write a Python program that asks the user 
to enter a number and then prints the sum of numbers 
from 1 to that number.

3.a Write a Python program that asks the user to enter 
a number n and then calculates and prints the factorial 
of that number (n!). The factorial of a non-negative integer 
n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

3.b Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a 
positive integer.calculate and print the sum of all even numbers 
from 1 to that integer.


while loop

4. wap to find factorial of input number use only while loop.

5. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a 
positive integer and then calculates and prints the sum of 
all even numbers from 2 to that integer (inclusive), using 
only a while loop. Make sure to handle the case where the user 
enters a non-positive integer by prompting them again until they 
enter a valid positive integer.

5a. calculating the factorial of a number 

5b. Calculate and print the sum of all 
numbers from 1 to a number entered by the user using a while loop:


6. Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to 10 using either a while loop or a for loop.
