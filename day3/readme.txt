1. For Loop:
The for loop in Python is used for iterating over a sequence 
(such as lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, etc.) or an iterable 
object a specific number of times. It allows you to execute a block 
of code repeatedly for each item in the sequence.

Syntax
for item in iterable:
    # Code block to execute for each item



Range Function:
The range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers. 
It is often used with for loops to iterate a specific number of 
times or to generate sequences of numbers for various purposes.


start: Optional. Specifies the starting value of the sequence (default is 0).
stop: Required. Specifies the end value of the sequence (it is not included in the sequence).
step: Optional. Specifies the increment (or decrement if negative) between each number in the sequence (default is 1).

syntax
range(start, stop, step)
    See book for diagrametically understanding

2. While Loop:
Purpose: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
Syntax:
while condition:
    # Code block to execute as long as condition is True



strings in python:

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within either single 
quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). Strings are immutable, meaning once they 
are created, their contents cannot be changed. You can perform various 
operations on strings, such as concatenation, slicing, and traversing.

    String Traversal:

    Traversal refers to the process of accessing each character in a string one by one.
    You can traverse a string using loops like for or while, or you can use indexing to 
    access individual characters.
