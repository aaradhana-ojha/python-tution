Introduction to Computer Networks
A computer network is a group of interconnected computers that 
communicate with each other to share resources and information. 
Networks can vary in size, from a small local area network (LAN) 
in a single office to a vast wide area network (WAN) spanning multiple 
countries. The primary purpose of networking is to enable communication 
and resource sharing, allowing multiple users to access the same data and 
applications, communicate via email and messaging, and connect to the internet.

Evolution of Networking
ARPANET
Origins: ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was 
the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor 
to the modern Internet. It was developed by the U.S. Department 
of Defense's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) in the late 1960s.
Significance: ARPANET introduced the concept of packet switching, 
which breaks down data into smaller packets that are transmitted 
independently and reassembled at the destination. This method is 
more efficient and robust compared to traditional circuit-switching.
Milestones: The first message was sent over ARPANET on October 29, 
1969, between UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute. By 1971, 
ARPANET had 15 nodes and continued to grow.
NSFNET
Origins: NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) was created by the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) in the mid-1980s to provide a backbone 
for academic and research institutions across the United States.
Significance: NSFNET expanded the reach of networking from a small number 
of research institutions to a broader range of universities and educational 
institutions. It provided higher bandwidth and more robust connections compared to ARPANET.
Milestones: NSFNET was established in 1985, and by 1991 it had replaced ARPANET 
as the primary backbone for the growing Internet. It laid the groundwork for the 
commercial and global expansion of the internet in the 1990s.
INTERNET
Origins: The term "Internet" refers to the global system of interconnected 
computer networks that use the Internet Protocol (IP) suite to link devices 
worldwide. The transition from NSFNET to the commercial Internet began in the early 1990s.
Significance: The internet revolutionized communication, commerce, entertainment, 
and information sharing. It enabled the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW), email, 
instant messaging, and countless other applications and services.
Milestones: In 1991, the NSF lifted restrictions on the commercial use of the NSFNET 
backbone, allowing private companies to build their own networks. By 1995, the NSFNET 
backbone was decommissioned, and the commercial internet took over. The development of 
the WWW by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 further accelerated the growth and accessibility of the internet.
Summary
The evolution of networking has been marked by significant milestones, starting with ARPANET, 
which introduced packet switching and laid the foundation for modern networking. NSFNET expanded 
the reach of networking to educational and research institutions, providing a higher-capacity 
backbone for data transmission. The transition to the commercial Internet in the 1990s, combined 
with the development of the World Wide Web, transformed the internet into a global system that 
impacts nearly every aspect of modern life. This evolution continues today with advancements in 
networking technologies, such as broadband, wireless networks, and the proliferation of Internet 
of Things (IoT) devices.
