1. Introduction to Relational Databases
Definition and Purpose: Relational databases store data in a structured format, 
using rows and columns. Each table (or relation) in a database represents a different 
entity, such as a customer or an order, with rows representing records and columns 
representing attributes or fields of the entity.

Key Concepts:

Tables (Relations): The fundamental structures that store data in a relational database. 
Each table has a unique name and consists of columns and rows. Columns represent the 
attributes of the data (like 'Name', 'Age', etc.), and each row represents a record or entry.
Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. For example, a 'CustomerID' field 
in a 'Customers' table could be the primary key, ensuring that every customer has a unique ID.
Foreign Key: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table, establishing 
a relationship between the two tables. For example, an 'Order' table might have a 'CustomerID' 
that refers to the 'CustomerID' in the 'Customers' table, linking orders to customers.

2. Basics of SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language): SQL is the standard language for managing and manipulating 
relational databases. It includes commands for creating, updating, deleting, and querying data.

Core SQL Operations:

CREATE TABLE: Defines a new table in the database, specifying its columns and data types.

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);
INSERT INTO: Adds new records to a table.

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, Name, Email) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

SELECT * FROM Customers;
UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.

UPDATE Customers SET Email = 'alice_new@example.com' WHERE CustomerID = 1;
DELETE: Removes records from a table.

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1;
ALTER TABLE: Modifies the structure of an existing table (e.g., adding or deleting columns).

ALTER TABLE Customers ADD COLUMN Phone VARCHAR(15);
3. Advanced SQL Operations
JOIN Operations: JOIN operations combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. 
The different types of joins allow for flexibility in how the data is combined.

INNER JOIN: Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.

SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table; fills NULLs for unmatched rows.
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table; fills NULLs for unmatched rows.
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
GROUP BY and HAVING:

GROUP BY is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like "total sales per customer."
HAVING is used to filter groups based on a condition.

SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(OrderID)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 5;
ORDER BY:

Sorts the result set based on specified columns.

SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Name ASC;
4. Data Integrity and Constraints
Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to maintain data integrity and ensure the database remains accurate and reliable.

NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL (empty) value.
UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are unique across the table.
CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column meet a specified condition.
DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified.
FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity between two tables.
PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row in a table, often combining NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.
5. Transactions and Concurrency Control
Transactions: A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure the ACID properties:

Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed; if one fails, the entire transaction fails.
Consistency: Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another.
Isolation: Ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other.
Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a power loss or crash.
Concurrency Control: Techniques to manage the simultaneous execution of transactions in a multi-user environment, ensuring that data is consistent.

BEGIN TRANSACTION: Starts a new transaction.
COMMIT: Saves all changes made during the transaction.
ROLLBACK: Reverts changes made during a transaction to the last committed state.
6. Database Normalization
Definition: Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The goal is to ensure that each piece of data is stored only once.

Normal Forms:

1NF (First Normal Form): Eliminates repeating groups by ensuring that each column contains only atomic (indivisible) values.
2NF (Second Normal Form): Removes partial dependencies (non-key attributes should depend on the whole primary key).
3NF (Third Normal Form): Removes transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.
7. SQL Functions and Subqueries
Aggregate Functions: Functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value:

COUNT: Counts the number of rows.
SUM: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
AVG: Returns the average value.
MIN: Returns the smallest value.
MAX: Returns the largest value.
Scalar Functions: Operate on a single value and return a single value.

UPPER: Converts a string to uppercase.
LOWER: Converts a string to lowercase.
ROUND: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
Subqueries: Nested queries used within another SQL query to provide intermediate results.


SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate > '2024-01-01');
8. Indexing
Definition: An index is a database object created to speed up the retrieval of rows by using pointers. Indexes are created on columns to improve search performance.

Types of Indexes:

Clustered Index: Physically sorts the data rows in the table based on their key values. A table can have only one clustered index.
Non-Clustered Index: Contains a sorted list of references (pointers) to the data in the table. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.
9. Stored Procedures and Triggers
Stored Procedures: A set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed as a single unit. They are used to encapsulate complex operations or business logic that can be reused.

Triggers: Special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table or view, such as inserting, updating, or deleting records.

10. Best Practices in SQL Development
Consistent Naming Conventions: Use clear, consistent names for tables, columns, and other database objects.
Avoid Redundant Data: Normalize tables to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.
Index Appropriately: Create indexes on columns that are frequently used in search conditions or joins.
Use Transactions Wisely: Use transactions to ensure that a series of related operations are completed successfully as a single unit.
Optimize Queries: Write efficient SQL queries to minimize resource usage and improve performance.
