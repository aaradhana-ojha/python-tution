Introduction to Data:

Data is essential for decision-making in various fields such as education, government, sports, and banking.
Examples include placement data in colleges, census data for policy-making, and customer data in banks.
Importance of Data:

Data is crucial for making informed decisions, such as analyzing market behavior or monitoring weather patterns.
Examples include dynamic pricing in businesses, electronic voting machines, and scientific experiments.
Types of Data:

Structured Data: Organized in a tabular format (rows and columns). Example: inventory data in a shop.
Unstructured Data: Lacks a fixed structure, such as web pages, emails, and multimedia files.
Data Collection:

Data can be gathered from various sources, including digital and manual formats.
Examples include sales data in a grocery store, social media analysis, and economic data by 
organizations like the World Bank.
Data Storage:

Data is stored on digital devices such as hard drives, SSDs, and memory cards for future retrieval.
The document also discusses the limitations of file processing and the advantages of Database 
Management Systems (DBMS).
Data Processing:

Data processing involves transforming raw data into meaningful information through steps like data 
entry, storage, classification, and updating.
Automated data processing is common in tasks like online bill payment and ticket booking.

Statistical Techniques for Data Processing:

Measures of Central Tendency: Includes mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value).
Measures of Variability: Includes range (difference between maximum and minimum values) and standard deviation 
(spread of data around the mean).


The document concludes by summarizing the importance of data, data processing cycles, 
and the use of statistical techniques for data analysis.
