1. Add Primary Key
Query:
ALTER TABLE GUARDIAN ADD PRIMARY KEY (GUID);
Explanation:

Primary Key: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. 
No two rows can have the same primary key, and it cannot be NULL.
Purpose: This query adds a primary key to the GUID column in the GUARDIAN table, 
ensuring that each GUID value is unique and non-null.

Query:
ALTER TABLE ATTENDANCE ADD PRIMARY KEY (AttendanceDate, RollNumber);
Explanation:

Composite Key: When two or more columns together uniquely identify a row, 
itâ€™s called a composite key.
Purpose: This query adds a composite primary key to the ATTENDANCE table 
using AttendanceDate and RollNumber. Together, these two columns must be unique for each row.

2. Add Foreign Key
Query:
ALTER TABLE STUDENT 
ADD FOREIGN KEY (GUID) REFERENCES GUARDIAN (GUID);
Explanation:

Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that 
uniquely identifies rows in another table. It creates a relationship between the two tables.
Purpose: This query adds a foreign key to the GUID column in the STUDENT table. 
This foreign key references the GUID column in the GUARDIAN table, meaning that 
the GUID values in STUDENT must exist in the GUARDIAN table.

3. Add UNIQUE Constraint
Query:
ALTER TABLE GUARDIAN 
ADD UNIQUE (GPhone);
Explanation:

UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are unique. 
No duplicate values are allowed.
Purpose: This query adds a UNIQUE constraint to the GPhone column 
in the GUARDIAN table, ensuring that no two records in the table can have the same phone number.

4. Add an Attribute
Query:
ALTER TABLE GUARDIAN 
ADD income INT;
Explanation:

Add Attribute: This command adds a new column to an existing table.
Purpose: The query adds a new column income of type INT (integer) 
to the GUARDIAN table, allowing the table to store information about the income of guardians.

5. Modify Datatype
Query:
ALTER TABLE GUARDIAN 
MODIFY GAddress VARCHAR(40);
Explanation:

Modify Datatype: Changes the data type or size of an existing column in a table.
Purpose: This query modifies the GAddress column in the GUARDIAN table, 
increasing its size from VARCHAR(30) to VARCHAR(40). This allows storing longer addresses.

6. Modify Constraint
Query:
ALTER TABLE STUDENT 
MODIFY SName VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL;
Explanation:

NOT NULL Constraint: Prevents a column from having NULL values.
Purpose: This query changes the SName column in the STUDENT table to 
NOT NULL, meaning every record in the STUDENT table must have a value for SName.

7. Add Default Value
Query:
ALTER TABLE STUDENT 
MODIFY SDateofBirth DATE DEFAULT '2000-05-15';
Explanation:

Default Value: Specifies a default value for a column if no value is provided during record insertion.
Purpose: This query sets a default value of '2000-05-15' for the SDateofBirth column in the STUDENT 
table. If no date of birth is provided when adding a student, this date will be automatically used.

8. Remove an Attribute
Query:
ALTER TABLE GUARDIAN 
DROP income;
Explanation:

Drop Attribute: Removes an existing column from a table.
Purpose: This query removes the income column from the GUARDIAN table, 
deleting all data stored in this column.

9. Remove Primary Key
Query:
ALTER TABLE GUARDIAN 
DROP PRIMARY KEY;
Explanation:

Drop Primary Key: Removes the primary key constraint from a table.
Purpose: This query removes the primary key from the GUARDIAN table. 
After executing this, the GUID column will no longer be required to be 
unique or non-null. However, removing a primary key may affect the 
integrity of your database if not managed carefully.
