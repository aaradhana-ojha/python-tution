Database Concepts: Introduction and Need
What is a Database?

A database is like a digital filing cabinet where information is stored in an organized way. 
It allows you to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. For example, a library database 
might store information about books, authors, and borrowers.


Why Do We Need Databases?

Imagine trying to keep track of all your friends' contact details in a notebook. 
It might get messy and hard to find information quickly. A database helps to organize 
this information neatly, making it easy to search, update, and manage large amounts 
of data accurately and quickly.

Relational Data Model
What is a Relational Data Model?
A relational data model organizes data into tables (also called relations). 
Each table is a collection of related data entries, similar to how you might 
organize data into rows and columns in a spreadsheet.


Key Terms in Relational Data Model
Relation (Table):

A relation is simply a table in a database. Each table stores data about a 
particular type of object or activity. For example, a "Students" table might 
store data about students in a school.
Attribute (Column):

An attribute is a column in a table, representing a specific type of information. 
For example, in a "Students" table, attributes could be "Name," "Age," and "Grade."
Tuple (Row):

A tuple is a row in a table, representing a single record or entry. For example, 
one row in the "Students" table would contain all the information (attributes) for one student.
Domain:

A domain refers to the set of possible values that an attribute can have. For example, 
the domain of the "Age" attribute might be any positive integer between 5 and 18.
Degree:

The degree of a relation is the number of attributes (columns) in the table. For example, 
if the "Students" table has columns for "Name," "Age," "Grade," and "ID," its degree is 4.
Cardinality:

The cardinality of a relation is the number of tuples (rows) in the table. For example, 
if there are 100 students listed in the "Students" table, the cardinality is 100.
Keys in a Relational Data Model
Keys are special attributes in a table that help identify records uniquely and establish 
relationships between tables.

Candidate Key:

A candidate key is an attribute, or a set of attributes, that can uniquely identify a 
row in a table. There can be multiple candidate keys in a table. For example, in a "Students" 
table, both "ID" and "Email" could be candidate keys.
Primary Key:

The primary key is a special candidate key chosen to uniquely identify each record in a table. 
There can only be one primary key in a table. For example, the "ID" attribute in the "Students" 
table could be the primary key.
Alternate Key:

An alternate key is any candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key. For example, if 
"ID" is the primary key, "Email" would be an alternate key.
Foreign Key:

A foreign key is an attribute in one table that links to the primary key of another table, 
creating a relationship between the two tables. For example, in a "Grades" table, a "StudentID" 
might be a foreign key that links to the "ID" in the "Students" table, showing which grades 
belong to which students.
