'''Write a program to calculate the following using modules:
(a)	Energy = m * g* h
(b)	Distance = ut + ½ at2
(c)	Speed = distance / time  
                                            OR
Write a program to calculate the volume and area of a sphere inside separate modules and import them in one complete package.
Volume = 4/3 π r3 
Surface Area =  = 4 π r2
