# main.py
# In Python, a module is simply a file containing Python definitions, functions, 
# and statements. The name of the file is the module name with the suffix .py. \
#Modules allow you to organize your code logically by grouping related functionality together.

#When you define functions within a module, you're essentially creating reusable blocks
#of code that can be imported and used in other Python scripts or modules.
# Here's a breakdown of how this works:


from my_module import greet

greet("Bob")
